                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p> <span>"</span>My name is Yu'an Lucht, and I'm a passionate Communication and Multimedia Design student at the University of Applied Sciences of Amsterdam! In my free time, 
                    I enjoy working out, riding my motorcycle, learning French, and designing. I am currently 22 years old and live in Flevoland.
                    I have a great passion for learning new things and trying out different activities. I also have a soft spot for cats and rabbits! I find my professional development very important and always strive to improve.
                    Prior to my current profession, I completed a three-year degree in Multimedia Design at ROC Hilversum, graduating at niveau 4. In addition, I also took a two-year elective called MVI 
                    (Media Vormgeving en ICT) during my time at VMBO. So, Iâ€™ve been working in design for about seven years now.<span>"</span>

                    <p>I have been working with Adobe Illustrator for the last 7 years, during this time
                        i have learned a lot about this application, and i can find my way very well 
                        within their interface. I can create logos, illustrations, posters, and so on.
                        I feel very comfortable within the Adobe Illustrator interface, and can work
                        very efficient within the application.

                    <p>Ever since i started my education at HvA (Hoogeschool van Amsterdam) I use Figma
                        almost in every project. I also use the application in my free time, since I 
                        enjoy experimenting with their tools. I also do a lot of ui/ux designs in my 
                        free time, to improve my skills within Figma.

                    <p>Within my profession (Communication & Multimedia Design) I get a lot of 
                        projects where coding is involved. I Love being able to get my creative
                        thoughts on a website with coding. I Have been coding for the past 3 years,
                        and i have mostly used HTML, CSS and Javascript. I mainly focus on 
                        Front-end Developing.

                    <p>Ever since i started my first profession and ellectives, i have been using
                        Adobe Photoshop. I know m way well around the interface and can create  things
                        when needed. Although i dont use photoshop often at my school, i am still
                        very familliar with the interface and toold. But a little warm-up wont hurt :P

                    <p>I personally find 3D moddeling in blender very facinating. I love being able
                        to make things 3D and seeing the final render. I have been using Blender for 
                        around 1.5years and i feel very comfortable around their interface.
